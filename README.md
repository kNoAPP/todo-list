# todo-list
A simple implementation of a todo-list website. 
This project was created as part of developedbyed's Creative Javascript Course.

The project has a few derivations made by kNoAPP in taking the course.
1. A different color pallete.
2. Added animations for filtering options in real time.
3. Modified local storage saving conventions.
4. Bug fixes on duplicate todo entries.

*Huge thanks to developedbyed for putting together this insightful course. There's a lot of good content in here not found in traditional education.*
